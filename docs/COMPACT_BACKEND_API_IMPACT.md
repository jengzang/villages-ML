# Compact Mode Backend API Impact

> Backend handoff document. Compact mode keeps analysis-result tables, keeps the raw village table for rerun/debugging, and does not keep the preprocessed village table or village-level derived tables.

## Current Table Policy

Compact mode should keep:

- Raw village table: `广东省自然村` for Guangdong, `全国自然村` for national.
- Small metadata tables generated during preprocessing: `metadata_overview_stats`, `region_hierarchy_stats`.
- Global/regional analysis result tables, including `char_similarity`.
- Regional centroid/result tables such as `regional_centroids`, `region_similarity`, `region_spatial_aggregates`, clustering summaries, semantic indices, n-gram summaries, and pattern summaries.

Compact mode should not keep:

- Preprocessed village table: `广东省自然村_预处理`, `全国自然村_预处理`.
- Village-level derived tables: `village_ngrams`, `village_semantic_structure`, `village_features`, `village_spatial_features`, `village_cluster_assignments`.

Important backend naming note:

- `T.VILLAGES` maps to the preprocessed village table.
- `T.VILLAGES_RAW` maps to the raw village table.
- `T.VILLAGES` usage is a compact blocker after preprocessed cleanup.
- `T.VILLAGES_RAW` usage is also a compact online-serving blocker. Raw tables are retained only for offline reruns/debugging, not as an API query source.

## APIs That Should Be Decoupled And Remain Supported

These APIs currently query `T.VILLAGES`, but they are not inherently village-detail APIs. They should be migrated to small/result tables so compact mode can keep supporting them.

| API | Current dependency | Replacement source | Compact decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /metadata/stats/overview` | `api/metadata/stats.py` counts `T.VILLAGES` | `metadata_overview_stats`; keep DB size/mtime from file system | Keep supported |
| `GET /metadata/stats/regions` | `api/metadata/stats.py` groups `T.VILLAGES` | `region_hierarchy_stats` | Keep supported |
| `GET /character/tendency/by-char` | tendency rows come from `char_regional_analysis`, but centroid is computed by joining `T.VILLAGES` | `regional_centroids` on `region_level` + hierarchy/name | Keep supported |
| `GET /regions/similarity/matrix` when `regions` is omitted | default top counties are selected from `T.VILLAGES` | `region_hierarchy_stats` where `level='county'`, ordered by `village_count DESC` | Keep supported |
| `GET /regions/list` | lists regions from `T.VILLAGES` | `region_hierarchy_stats` filtered by level | Keep supported |

### Why These Can Be Decoupled

They only need region-level counts, hierarchy, or centroids. Those are already final analytical/metadata facts, not per-village details.

Phase0 already materializes:

- `metadata_overview_stats`: `total_villages`, `total_cities`, `total_counties`, `total_townships`, `unique_characters`, `generated_at`, `data_version`.
- `region_hierarchy_stats`: `level`, `name`, `city`, `county`, `township`, `parent`, `village_count`, `sort_key`, `generated_at`, `data_version`.

Phase12 already materializes:

- `regional_centroids`: `region_level`, `city`, `county`, `township`, `region_name`, `centroid_lon`, `centroid_lat`, `village_count`.

So the backend does not need to retain the preprocessed table for these APIs.

## APIs That Currently Read Raw Tables And Must Be Migrated

| API group | Main current sources | Compact decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /regional/aggregates/city` | `T.VILLAGES_RAW` + `semantic_indices` | Must migrate off raw. Use `region_hierarchy_stats` for counts and `semantic_indices` for semantic percentages. If `avg_name_length` must remain in the response, materialize it into a small regional aggregate table; otherwise disable in compact. |
| `GET /regional/aggregates/county` | `T.VILLAGES_RAW` + `semantic_indices` | Same as city. Must not scan raw in compact. |
| `GET /regional/aggregates/town` | `T.VILLAGES_RAW` + `semantic_indices` | Same as city. Must not scan raw in compact. |
| `GET /regional/vectors` | `semantic_indices` + `T.VILLAGES_RAW` for hierarchy filtering/reconstruction | Must migrate raw hierarchy lookup to `region_hierarchy_stats`. Keep supported after migration; disable in compact until migrated. |

For `/regional/aggregates/*`, the existing compact-safe pieces are:

- `region_hierarchy_stats.village_count` for region counts.
- `semantic_indices.raw_intensity` and `semantic_indices.village_count` for semantic category percentages/counts.

The current raw-table calculation of `avg_name_length` has no confirmed compact replacement table. Backend should either:

- use a future small table such as `regional_basic_stats(region_level, city, county, township, region_name, village_count, avg_name_length)`;
- or remove/return `null` for that field by explicit API contract change;
- or disable these endpoints in compact mode.

## APIs That Already Use Only Compact Result Tables

These routes use retained result tables in their normal path and do not need raw/preprocessed village tables.

| API group | Main current sources | Compact decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /regional/spatial-aggregates` | `region_spatial_aggregates` | Keep supported |
| `POST /regional/vectors/compare` | `semantic_indices` | Keep supported |
| `POST /regional/vectors/compare/batch` | `semantic_indices` | Keep supported |
| `POST /regional/vectors/reduce` | `semantic_indices` plus runtime PCA/t-SNE | Functionally supported; online compute cost should be bounded |
| `POST /regional/vectors/cluster` | `semantic_indices` plus runtime clustering | Functionally supported; online compute cost should be bounded |
| `POST /compute/semantic/cooccurrence` | `semantic_bigrams` or `semantic_bigrams_detailed` | Keep supported |
| `POST /compute/semantic/network` | `semantic_bigrams` or `semantic_bigrams_detailed` | Keep supported |
| `POST /compute/clustering/character-tendency` | `char_regional_analysis` | Keep supported, but bound online clustering size/timeout |
| `POST /compute/clustering/spatial-aware` | `spatial_clusters` JSON fields | Keep supported if `spatial_clusters` is retained |

## APIs To Disable In Compact Mode

These APIs return or compute village-level data. Compact mode intentionally does not keep the tables needed to serve them.

Recommended behavior: return a controlled response such as HTTP `501 Not Implemented` or `422 Unprocessable Entity` with a clear message:

```text
This compact database does not include village-level detail tables.
```

Do not let these routes fail with raw SQLite errors like `no such table`.

| API | Required compact-missing tables | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /village/search` | `T.VILLAGES` | Disable |
| `GET /village/search/detail` | `T.VILLAGES`, `village_features`, `village_spatial_features`, `village_cluster_assignments` | Disable |
| `GET /village/ngrams/{village_id}` | `T.VILLAGES`, `village_ngrams` | Disable |
| `GET /village/semantic-structure/{village_id}` | `T.VILLAGES`, `village_semantic_structure` | Disable |
| `GET /village/features/{village_id}` | `T.VILLAGES`, `village_features` | Disable |
| `GET /village/spatial-features/{village_id}` | `T.VILLAGES`, `village_spatial_features`, `village_cluster_assignments` | Disable |
| `GET /village/complete/{village_id}` | `T.VILLAGES`, `village_features`, `village_spatial_features`, `village_cluster_assignments`, `village_semantic_structure`, `village_ngrams` | Disable |
| `POST /subset/filter` | `T.VILLAGES`, optionally `village_features`, `village_semantic_structure` | Disable |
| `POST /compute/subset/cluster` | `village_features`; optionally `T.VILLAGES` for coordinates | Disable |
| `POST /compute/subset/compare` | `village_features`; optionally `T.VILLAGES` for coordinates | Disable |
| `POST /compute/features/extract` | `village_features`; optionally `T.VILLAGES` for coordinates | Disable |
| `POST /compute/features/aggregate` | `village_features`, `village_semantic_structure`, optionally `village_cluster_assignments` | Disable unless rewritten to use compact regional result tables |
| `POST /compute/clustering/run` | can read precomputed regional aggregate tables, but falls back to `village_features` if aggregate tables are missing/empty | Keep only if backend forbids fallback or compact profile guarantees aggregate tables exist; otherwise disable |
| `POST /compute/clustering/scan` | same as clustering run | Keep only if backend forbids fallback or compact profile guarantees aggregate tables exist; otherwise disable |
| `POST /compute/clustering/sampled-villages` | village-level sampling | Disable |
| `POST /compute/clustering/hierarchical` | currently uses `T.VILLAGES` for hierarchy and compute-engine data flows | Disable until rewritten against `region_hierarchy_stats` and result tables |

Raw-table routes are conditional compact blockers:

| API | Current dependency | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /regional/aggregates/city` | `T.VILLAGES_RAW` | Disable in compact until migrated to compact small/result tables |
| `GET /regional/aggregates/county` | `T.VILLAGES_RAW` | Disable in compact until migrated to compact small/result tables |
| `GET /regional/aggregates/town` | `T.VILLAGES_RAW` | Disable in compact until migrated to compact small/result tables |
| `GET /regional/vectors` | `T.VILLAGES_RAW` for hierarchy | Disable in compact until hierarchy lookup uses `region_hierarchy_stats` |

## APIs That Should Stay Supported

These API families query compact-retained result tables and do not need preprocessed/village-level derived tables in their normal path:

- `GET /character/frequency/global`
- `GET /character/frequency/regional`
- `GET /character/tendency/by-region`
- `GET /character/embeddings/*`
- `GET /character/significance/*`
- `GET /semantic/category/*`
- `GET /semantic/subcategory/*`
- `GET /semantic/labels/*`
- `GET /semantic/composition/*`
- `GET /semantic/indices`
- `GET /ngrams/frequency`
- `GET /ngrams/regional`
- `GET /ngrams/patterns`
- `GET /ngrams/tendency`
- `GET /ngrams/significance`
- `GET /patterns/*`
- `GET /clustering/assignments`
- `GET /clustering/assignments/by-region`
- `GET /clustering/profiles`
- `GET /clustering/metrics`
- `GET /clustering/metrics/best`
- `GET /spatial/hotspots`
- `GET /spatial/hotspots/{hotspot_id}`
- `GET /spatial/clusters`
- `GET /spatial/clusters/summary`
- `GET /spatial/clusters/available-runs`
- `GET /spatial/integration*`
- `POST /compute/semantic/cooccurrence`
- `POST /compute/semantic/network`
- `POST /compute/clustering/character-tendency`
- `POST /compute/clustering/spatial-aware`
- `GET /metadata/stats/tables`
- `GET /admin/run-ids/*`

`GET /metadata/stats/tables` introspects SQLite metadata. It should remain supported and will naturally show that compact-disabled village-level tables are absent.

## Backend Migration Recommendations

1. Add a compact capability check in the backend.

   Suggested implementation: detect absence of `T.VILLAGES` or presence of a future `query_policy_config` flag such as `profile='compact'`.

2. Migrate small metadata reads first.

   Update `/metadata/stats/overview`, `/metadata/stats/regions`, `/regions/list`, and `/regions/similarity/matrix` default region selection to use `metadata_overview_stats` and `region_hierarchy_stats`.

3. Migrate centroid reads.

   Update `/character/tendency/by-char` to use `regional_centroids` rather than joining the preprocessed table.

4. Gate village-detail and online village-compute routes.

   The route should fail early with an intentional compact-mode message before constructing SQL against missing tables.

5. Migrate or disable raw-table realtime regional APIs.

   These APIs must not query raw in compact mode. Migrate `/regional/aggregates/*` to `region_hierarchy_stats` + `semantic_indices` plus a small materialized replacement for `avg_name_length` if that field remains required. Migrate `/regional/vectors` hierarchy validation/reconstruction to `region_hierarchy_stats`.

## Compact API Disable List For Backend Coordination

The backend team can use this as the initial route-level compact denylist:

```text
GET  /api/villages/village/search
GET  /api/villages/village/search/detail
GET  /api/villages/village/ngrams/{village_id}
GET  /api/villages/village/semantic-structure/{village_id}
GET  /api/villages/village/features/{village_id}
GET  /api/villages/village/spatial-features/{village_id}
GET  /api/villages/village/complete/{village_id}
POST /api/villages/subset/filter
POST /api/villages/compute/subset/cluster
POST /api/villages/compute/subset/compare
POST /api/villages/compute/features/extract
POST /api/villages/compute/features/aggregate
POST /api/villages/compute/clustering/sampled-villages
POST /api/villages/compute/clustering/hierarchical
```

Conditional compact gates:

```text
GET  /api/villages/regional/aggregates/city
GET  /api/villages/regional/aggregates/county
GET  /api/villages/regional/aggregates/town
GET  /api/villages/regional/vectors
POST /api/villages/compute/clustering/run
POST /api/villages/compute/clustering/scan
```

The regional routes may remain enabled only after they stop querying `T.VILLAGES_RAW`. The clustering routes may remain enabled only when the backend guarantees they read regional aggregate tables and do not fall back to `village_features`.

Keep `GET /api/villages/compute/clustering/cache-stats` and `DELETE /api/villages/compute/clustering/cache` if the compute router remains mounted; they do not require village tables by themselves.
